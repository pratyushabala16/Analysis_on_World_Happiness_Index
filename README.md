## Analyzing The World Happiness Report


*About the Data:
The World Happiness Report is a publication that contains articles and rankings of national happiness
based on global survey data to report how people evaluate their own lives in more than 150 countries
worldwide, which the report also correlates with various quality of life factors. This year marks the 10th
anniversary of the World Happiness Report, and we have chosen to analyze the world happiness report to
find out what factors influence happiness across the world.


*From the dataset we get the following Interesting questions :
• What are the attributes which best quantify happiness ?
• Are all factors given in the report necessary & reliable quantifiers of happiness or are they biased in
any way ?
• Are there any paradoxes contrary to our logical thinking observed through data visualization ?
• Are there any other factors which can improve the report ?

* We have created an interactive world map using ggmaps in RShiny to display the distribution of 2019 Happiness Index,
visualized relationships between life factors in the World Happiness report and analyzed changes in Happiness
coefficients pre and amidst-pandemic.
* Analyzed the setbacks of the report and proposed better improvement factors.
* Fitted Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Support Vector Regression and
compared their accuracy in prediction.

Here are some glimpses of the Rshiny app.
